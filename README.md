# NeuralNet
Old Code Implementing Neural Networks

This repo is just an archive of code I wrote in the Summer of 2015, as part of a paper I and several classmate were working on for the Siemens Competition. The objective was to take a corpus of BBC articles and train a neural network to identify keywords from the articles and synthesize a summary sentence. In doing so I ended up writing various implementations of Feed Forward, Recurrent, and Long Short-Term Memory neural networks. At this point the code is probably deprecated or at the very least extremely finicky. Read at your own risk.
